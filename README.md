# react-axios-image-uploader
Just a simple react component that converts images to base64 for uploading to an SQL database img-url field

Place the component in your react project, change the url variable to be the endpoint that the post request should be sent to and you're good to go.

Plans for future improvements
- Validating max base64 string size 
- Built in compression of strings that exceed maximum byte size
